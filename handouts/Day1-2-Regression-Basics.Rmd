# What is a Regression?

> The problem is that regression is like a demon or djinn from folktale. It answers exactly that question that you asked it. Often you don't realize though that you asked the wrong question ~ paraphrasing Richard McElreath


## The goal

## The regression machine

## Pay close attention to the machine

You cannot simply throw everything in.
Collider, Confounder, Post-treatment, multicollinearity -> outlook to next day.

## Recap: What is uncertaint about our estimates?

## Two approaches: Bayesian and Frequentist
